#Final Project

Research Question
When a natural disaster occurs, how do our digital identities influence the information we receive about this?

Some of the key questions we will be addressing are: 

How are digital technologies transforming society? 

To what extent do digital technologies curb or enhance our rights and freedom? 

What digital skills are needed for the knowledge economy and a democratic society? 

How can we build and use our online identities? 

How might we use digital technologies as creative and engaging forms of communication?

As a species, we are more connected than ever before, I saw this first handedly as I studied abroad from May to January. Though I am a citizen of the United States, I shared a common citizenship with the people I met on my travels. Everyone I met was also a digital citizen. 

What is a digital citizen? 

In the archives of London, we explored old global citizenship passports. In 1948, many people were interested in becoming a digital citizen and signed up to receive these passports.  A digital citizen is the closest we’ve gotten to achieving global citizenship. The internet allows for people all over the world to have a platform and identity. According to [Coed Tech](http://laurabiancoedtech.weebly.com/digital-rights-and-responsibilities.html), some Key Digital Rights are the:
Right to access and use computers and/or other electronic devices
Right to access and use digital content
Right to create and share digital media
Right to privacy in digital communities
Right to express your ideas and opinions freely
Right to report anyone or anything that seems inappropriate
Some Digital Citizenship responsibilities are:
Use appropriate language and behavior when interacting with others (i.e. no cyberbullying)
Respect the opinions and ideas of others
Obey all intellectual property laws
Do not use or share others' work without permission
Follow rules and/or codes of conduct for every Internet site 
Responsibility to report cyberbullying, threats, and inappropriate use of digital resources
Define Digital Identity
In class we analyzed a map created for Jisc Digital Leaders Programme, called [V&R](https://daveowhite.com/vandr/vr-mapping/). According to Professor David White, "The mapping process V&R stands for a Visitors and Residents based group activity which is designed to explore individuals engagement with the Web. It’s a good starting point for discovering how staff, students or clients are using the Web." Imagine a spectrum from Visitor to Resident, where visitors leave the least traceable impact online, and residents leave the most. Where you land on this spectrum is your digital identity.

V&R map of Mom & Brother
To see where you land on the spectrum, you can make a V&R map. Draw a horizontal line from Visitor to Resident. The, draw a vertical line from Personal to Institutional. Depending on your email, social media, and search engine activity, where do you have the most presence on the map?
General idea: Mom is more of a visitor and Leo is more of a resident


Podcast Question Ideas
Are we more or less free with the rise of digital citizenship?
What type of digital citizen are you?
What role does your digital identity play in your real life?
I have friends all over the world. Grandma lives in California. Cousins live in Vietnam. Dad’s best friend lives in Australia. Cousins live in Tahiti. Would it be possible to maintain long distance relationships without digital citizenships?
Now that we’ve talked about your online presence and interactions, how does this relate to the spread of information, specifically about natural disasters?

Natural Disaster misinformation
According to [homeland security](https://www.dhs.gov/natural-disasters), a natural disaster includes any type of severe weather, which has the potential to pose a significant threat to human health and safety, property, critical infrastructure, and homeland security. This qualifies volcanic eruption as a natural disaster.

According to [USGS](“Mauna Loa is the largest active volcano on our planet, rising gradually to 4,170 meters (13,681 feet) above sea level. Its long submarine flanks descend an additional 5 kilometers (3 miles) below sea level to the ocean floor. The ocean floor directly beneath Mauna Loa is, in turn, depressed by the volcano's great mass another 8 kilometers (5 miles). This places Mauna Loa's summit about 17,000 meters (56,000 feet) above its base. The enormous volcano covers half of the Island of Hawaiʻi and by itself amounts to about 85 percent of all the other Hawaiian Islands combined.

Eruptions typically start at the summit and, within minutes to months of eruption onset, about half of the eruptions migrate into either the Northeast or Southwest Rift Zone. Since its first well-documented eruption in 1843, the volcano has erupted 34 times with intervals between eruptions ranging from months to decades. Mauna Loa last erupted in the months of November and December 2022

Mauna Loa eruptions tend to produce voluminous, fast-moving lava flows that can impact communities on the east and west sides of the Island of Hawaiʻi. Since the mid-19th century, the city of Hilo in east Hawaiʻi has been threatened by seven Mauna Loa lava flows. Mauna Loa lava flows have reached the south and west coasts of the island eight times: in 1859, 1868, 1887, 1926, 1919, and three times in 1950.”)

Information about the eruption of the world’s largest volcano was spread globally. People in England asked if my family was okay, and I heard stories of friends evacuating their homes or leaving the island. I heard that the sulfur dioxide, vog, and carbon dioxide was causing air pollution. From your experience in Kohala, an isolated part of the island from common tradewinds and people, was there much panic regarding the eruption? 

Did you see a difference in how it was perceived globally vs. right in your backyard?

In Hawai’i, we live in conjunction with natural disasters. This ranges from hurricanes, to tsunamis, to fires, to exploding volcanos. 

Digital Identities in relation to natural disaster
If natural disaster were to occur, and a flood or fire took our possessions, our digital identities would still exist in the cloud, which even includes the website for our family business. 

Would our digital identities aid in our identification and security?

Can we use our digital identities to help those in need
-such as finding an escape plan
-communicating basic shelter locations
